# 🚗 Electric Vehicle Adoption Forecasting

## 📌 Problem Statement
Using the electric vehicle dataset (which includes information on EV populations, vehicle types, and possibly historical charging usage), the objective is to build a machine learning model that can forecast future electric vehicle (EV) adoption. For example, we aim to predict the number of EVs in upcoming years based on historical trends and relevant factors.
